**Evaluators: [Wason, Manan](mailto:mwason1@jhu.edu) and [Shirish, Singh](mailto:shirish@jhu.edu)**

### Attendance and contribution
[5 points] (Anyone missing without an advanced excuse?  Everyone doing at least some talking?)

- All present.

### Overview of project
[10 points] (Clearly explained and understandable?  Got us at least a little excited about the app?)

- Great background and objective.

### Demo
[25 points] (Clear?  No glitches?  Good progress shown?)

- Video demo. Shows basic features.

- Would have been better if you showed a live demo.

(-5 points)

### Architecture
[5 points] (Explained clearly?)

- Elegant architecture. Might need some changes later.

- Still need to review whether to keep all the databases. All databases not shown in architecture.

(-1 Points)

### Code review
[5 points] (Some interesting code or algorithm/architecture explained well?)

- Algorithm is non-trivial. Good work!

- Clustering algorithm was good but still has some glitches and need more thinking

(-1 point)

### Presentation organization
[10 points] (Presentation started promptly? Flow was smooth from speaker to speaker?  No need to huddle mid-presentation to decide what to do next?)

- Well organized presentation.

- All good here

### Talking
[15 points] (Easy to understand speech and points being made?)

- All good here

### Quality of slides
[15 points] (Information easily readable and well presented?)

- Nice theme and layout.

### Project comments emerging during the talk
[10 points] (Technical comments about the project itself not fitting into any of the above can go here)

- Do not save all time points, improve performance by taking one single snapshot of the entire trip. Look at Uber's technique as a reference.
- Time based path changes or in general? Does it change at night? - No time based routing. Add it as an extended feature for your project.
