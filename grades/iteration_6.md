# Iteration 6 Evaluation - Group 14 WalkLive

### Presentation
(Was the presentation itself done well - was it well-organized, easy to understand, and convincing?)

Nice slides and well organized presentation.  One person didn't talk, everyone needs to talk some.

#### App demo
(Did app work well?  Did any errors arise during the demo?  How did the demo'd implementation line up with features proposed?)

Your demo worked well.

#### UI quality based on the demo
(Was it well-designed? Was it usable?  Did it have glitches?)

Generally good.

### Testing and Coverage
(Continue to write more tests for new features and keep high coverage?)

Good test coverage.

### Build and Deployment and git usage
(Same as previous iterations)

Good here.

### Non-CRUD feature
(How did it turn out?)

Good idea to cut into regions for clustering

### Iteration progress reporting
(Final CHANGELOG.md and project boards updated?)

Good here.

### Evaluation of project difficulty
(in terms of lines of code, conceptual difficulty, non-CRUD features, degree of completion)

### Overall Remarks

Congratulations for getting your app across the finish line.  Your team had a lot to learn as you did not have much experience, and were behind on many of the iterations.  But you ended up with a nice result.

**Grade: 91/100**
