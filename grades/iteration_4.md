# Iteration 4 Evaluation - Group 14

**Evaluator: [Wason, Manan](mailto:mwason1@jhu.edu)**

### Implementation progress
[25 points] (More features working?  Improved demo running?  Good progress on non-CRUD including some integration? Project is looking to have appropriate degree of difficulty overall?)

I've seen a lot of progress here. Great job!

#### Code Quality
[10 points] (Good file structure?  Good use of object-oriented design principles thus far in codebase?  Correct use of frameworks?  Are there other frameworks or tools you should be using that you are not now?)

All good here!

### Testing
[20 points] (A fully functioning test harness using good code methodology in terms of test setup and tear-down?)

You should consider adding teardown methods as well that restore the state of the environments. 
(-2 points)

#### Test coverage
[10 points] Good coverage with tests?

Even though you seem to have a lot of tests, you should increase your coverage a bit. You're almost there!


#### Travis
[5 points] (Travis-CI integration tests working?  Tests are at integration level?)

All good here!

#### Fully automated build of your project with a README.md describing how to build it
[5 points]

All good here!

### Deployment
[5 points] (Server deployed on Heroku or AWS or other?)

This needs to be fixed ASAP. 

(-5 points)

### Advanced Git usage
[10 points] (Still being good about regular commits, pull requests, etc?  Additionally, development primarily taking place on feature branches, no personal-named branches, good git workflow overall?)

You should consider using branches to add new features and then make pull requests to merge them to master. Everything else looks good.

(-5 Points)

### Iteration submission and reporting

You can increase the amount of documentation in your wiki.

#### CHANGELOG.md updated and project boards updated, filling in goals for iterations 5 and 6
[10 points]

All good here!

### Other Remarks

Great going! Just some minor things you need to fix

**Grade: 88/100**
