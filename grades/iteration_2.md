# Iteration 2 Evaluation - Group 14

**Evaluator: [Wason, Manan](mailto:mwason1@jhu.edu)**

### Features
(Modifications if any are good?  Key and extended features marked as was required in the assignment?)

Really impressed by the changes you've made in this past week. Great work on the UI sketches and architecture diagrams but since in the lab, you said that you have routing as an extended feature but you haven't mentioned that anywhere else, I'll have to deduct some points.

(-5 points)

### UI sketches
(Improved as either needed or required based on iteration 1 feedback?)

UI sketches look great now but you need to prototype to see if they're feasible. I expect this to be done by next iteration.

### Endpoint and/or other interface documentation
(Complete relative to UI sketches, UML, etc?  JSON in/out shown?  Error code cases shown?)

Everything good here. You guys did a good job here!

### UML Class diagram
(Good coverage of design?  Proper use of whole-part diamonds, associations, multiplicities, etc?  Actions in app mapped to methods?)

UML seems good. Has all multiplicities, actions etc.

### Architecture
(Revisions if any are good/appropriate?  Described well and pictured if it is not standard?)

Good to know that you have finalised a backend framework.

### Initial code
(Challenging libraries prototyped?  Server stood up and some basic code written?  Frontend prototyped? 100+ lines of original code, not just pasting in a tutorial?)

All good here.

#### Initial commit made
(did every group member commit at least once to the repo as was required in the assignment?)
Seems like everyone commited

### Other General Remarks

Great progress but you need to prototype atleast some of the UI by the next lab to see if it's actually feasible.

**Grade: 95/100**
