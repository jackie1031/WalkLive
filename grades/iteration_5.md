# Iteration 5 Evaluation - Group 14

**Evaluator: [Wason, Manan](mailto:mwason1@jhu.edu)**

### Implementation progress
[25 points] (Core app working including non-CRUD integration?  Features filling out?  UI starting to look good even though it still may have some glitches?)

Great progress here! You need to work on your non-CRUD and UI stuff. We can have better validations and success/error screens on the frontend.

#### Code Quality
[30 points] (Good use of object-oriented design principles in codebase?  Absence of smells in code?)

Code quality on the frontend is pretty decent but on the otherhand, there's a lot of repetative java code. You need to refactor a lot of things there.

(-5 points)

### Testing and Coverage
[20 points] (Continue to write more tests for new features and improve coverage?)

I see that you've commented out most of your tests. Is it because of the heroku issue? But I thought we solved it, right?

(-5 points)

**Edit**

(-2.5 points)

#### Fully automated build of your project with a README.md describing how to build it
[5 points] (Same as previous iteration)

All good here!

### Deployment
[5 points] (Same as previous iteration)

Heroku deployment isn't working right now but if you get it to work by Monday, I'll revert the deduction.

### Advanced Git usage
[10 points] (Same as previous iteration)

Looking good here!

### Iteration submission and reporting

#### CHANGELOG.md updated and project boards updated, filling in goals for iteration 6
[10 points]

All good here! Just want to point out that even though you're updating project boards, you're not really moving stuff to a completed board. You should use the project board to track your progress.

### Other Remarks


**Grade: 92.5/100**
