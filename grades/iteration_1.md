## Iteration 1 Evaluation - Group 14

**Evaluator: [Wason, Manan](mailto:mwason1@jhu.edu)**

### The project idea 
(Too easy or too difficult? A coherent application?)
Idea is pretty good. We all need an interactive safety map.

### Features
(Do features align with vision, UI sketches, and use-cases? Are there non-CRUD features?)

Features are all relevant and there are enough non CRUD features too.

### UI sketches
(Complete with respect to features? Realistic visions of the app that have "real fake" data in them?)

You should do UI sketches again as they're not really clear right now and you need to see if the UI that you're proposing is actually possible or not using the iOS UiKit.

### Use Cases
(Are all important multi-step actions not clear from the UI sketches presented in use-cases?)
Since UI's are hand drawn, it doesn't reflect the extent of how it's really going to look becasuse I can see things that might not even be possible in iOS but otherwise usecases are clear.

### Architecture
(Are the choices realistic? Is serious prototyping work needed to ensure the app is feasible?)

You didn't add the tech stack or the architecture diagram that you plan to use in your iteration 1 submission. Also as we talked about in one of the labs, you can't use Firebase. You'll have to implement your own server that can

### General Remarks

The idea is really great and I would love to see this turning into a live project on the App Store. You just need to start planning a bit on how you would go about doing it.
